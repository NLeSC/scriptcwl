Remove named entities from a directory of text files
====================================================

In this example, we create a pipeline that replaces named entities in a collection
of (Dutch) text documents.
Named entities are objects in text referred to by proper names, such as persons,
organizations, and locations. In the workflow, named entities will be
replaced with their named entity type (i.e., PER (person), ORG (organization),
LOC (location), or UNSP (unspecified)).
The workflow can be used as part of a data anonimization procedure.

The workflow consists of the following steps:

* Extract named entities from text documents using an existing tool called `frog <https://languagemachines.github.io/frog/>`_
* Convert frog output to `SAF, a generic representation for text data <https://github.com/vanatteveldt/saf>`_
* Aggregate data about named entities that occur in the text files
* Replace named entities with their named entity type in the SAF documents
* Convert SAF documents to text

All steps required for this workflow are available through `nlppln <https://github.com/nlppln/nlppln>`_.
